# Car Price Prediction

This project performs regression analysis to predict car prices using various machine learning and statistical techniques. The dataset contains several features related to car attributes, and the project applies data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation methods. I primarily use linear regression for predicting car prices.


## Overview
This project aims to develop a model that accurately predicts the price of a car based on its features, such as engine size, horsepower, and other attributes. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using linear regression. This project can be useful for understanding the factors that influence car prices and can be extended to more complex machine learning models in the future.
## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, etc.
- Regression Model: Linear regression model applied to predict car prices.
- Performance Evaluation: Metrics like R-squared and RMSE are used for evaluation.
- Data Visualization: Visualizations to show relationships between features and target values.
## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language for this project.
- Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing linear regression and other ML models.
- Statsmodels: For regression analysis and statistical tests.

## Results

- The linear regression model was able to capture key relationships between car attributes and their prices. Some notable results include:

- R-squared Value: The model explained X% of the variance in the car prices.
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): The modelâ€™s RMSE was approximately Y, showing its performance.

- Visualizations:
  
      1. Heatmaps to show correlations between features.
  
      2. Scatter plots to demonstrate relationships between attributes like engine size and price.
